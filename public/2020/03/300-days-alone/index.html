            <p>it was only upon my arrival at the Geneva Airport that I realized it was over. Over there it was difficult physically but mostly psychologically and if I had to to do it again, Well I do not think I would.</p>
<p>In september 2008. I left Switzerland and it is comfort to spend 10 months alone in the archipelago of tonga in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to live, I brought with me a machete and my swiss knife I also had a medical kit, satellite phone, solar panel and battery to supply energy for my camera. It is a dream I wanted to realize I have been working for 14 months for it and now, now I am here but I think the most important thing is to stay zen and to keep calm, Because whatever happens, I will be alone. The archipelago of Tonga is lost in the middle of the Pacific Ocean the island of Tofua(阿岛) is about 250 kilometers away from the capital and its last inhabitant left more or less 20 years ago. Tofua is a caldera. a former volcano which exploded. in the middle there is a lake of sulfuric(含硫的) water, and north of the island, you can see the smoke from the still active volcano.</p>
<p>That is only 24 hours I am here I&rsquo;m missing food I&rsquo;m missing drink/water, I&rsquo;m missing everything. It is horrible, no it is not horrible but it teaches me that you can not do it at the first time you have to go step by step and I have to learn and it takes much more time than what I expected.</p>
<p><img src="/img/fish.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>The next day, I installed my solar panel to charge my batteries and I went back fishing. And sundown, I still had not caught anything.
But just as I was about to give up. I caught my first fish. to top that, it was big enough to feed me over the next two days. I feel good, I feel much better than this morning, because I could get a fish I could eat it and I still have a little bit for tomorrow then I am happy. I will just finished this fire again five minutes, ten minutes and after I go sleep. Because I don&rsquo;t want to waste some wood. There is many but It&rsquo;s not dry all the wood is wet.</p>
<p><img src="/img/full-of-ants.png" alt="image">
<img src="/img/building-somke-house.png" alt="image">
Hello, it&rsquo;s full of ants. I can not even eat it anymore. Oh yeah, right, I was sure, they got it all. There were not many friends on the island. I had to find a way to preserve my fishing. At home in the Alps, the elders used to use two ways to preserve they meat, salting and smoking. All right, the target is to make something to smoke the fish because I hope to have many many fishes, no many many fish and I need to smoke them. Building the smoke house did not take too much time, I worked perfectly, my grandfather would have been proud of me.</p>
<p><img src="/img/building-root.png" alt="image">
For the first two days I sleep as I could, using the curved trunk（弯曲木头） of the coconut tree(椰子🌲), but I was not going to spend ten months like that. I had to build a shelter for myself. I stared with the roof. for the roofing, I used coconut branches that played it through the paneling hoping this would not let the water through. and four days later, my shelter was built. And I was able to move onto something else.</p>
<p><img src="/img/stop-time.png" alt="image">
I still had to accomplish an important ritual in order to live at nature rhythm. I had to stop time the thing is, I should find a nice place for the watch not too far from the ocean, so even if it is underground, it can get a good vibe form the sea. from now on I will be here for nine months and 20 days approximately by myself, where I have stopped the time.</p>
<p><img src="/img/auto-fishing-machine.png" alt="image">
<img src="/img/bon-appetite.png" alt="image">
At the beginning, fishing took most of my time. I was not catching fish every day and I was spending long hours waiting for them to bite. I imagined a system to free myself from this chore(日常工作). The principle was simple a very heavy branch as a fishing rod one heavy stone as a counterweight the fishing line and the bait(鱼饵）and that did the trick. All right that&rsquo;s finished, I am exhausted. It looks very easy I know how to do it but I don&rsquo;t eat so much now because I don&rsquo;t have the choice and my drink that&rsquo;s okay but every time I have to do a physical effort I feel tired very easily now I will have a rest,
I am not in a hurry neither anyway. When you are hungry, you are less picky(挑剔的，难伺候的). I found some sea snails(🐌), well, only a few of them not enough to fest. Well, bon appetite.</p>
<p><img src="/img/crached-after%20-eight-days.png" alt="image">
The lack of food, the sudden solitude(独居), No point of reference. I don&rsquo;t know what weighted on me the most, but after eight days I cracked.</p>
<p>My family is missing me, everything I know is missing me actually. Here is nice but I can not discover, I have no food. I have water. yes but it is so hard it is very hard. I my house I have everything, then I say why are you doing this, you know? you could stay at home, cool with your friends, girlfriend,
family.</p>
<p><img src="/img/whales.png" alt="image">
It just hit me without warning, I was down in the dumps. Twenty-two thousand kilometers away from home, far from my friends , my family, my fridge, and worst of all, this was my idea. Fortunately I had the flag of the motivation. on which my friends had written me messages reading them gave me the courage to go on and to stop this, it was that day I saw whales for the first time and when you see this, I can tell you forget all your problems.</p>
<p>I miss many things here and there is many things I have here that I can not have home, but in the morning it is very hard to put this in mind but in the evening I feel this agin and I feel very happy I feel quiet, I think what I have to learn is to go slowly now. I have to learn to take the time to do everything here still everything I do I want to do it fast, to make it finish as quick as possible.</p>
<p>I had to put this, this plastic which was the protection of my solar panel, because I realized that my roof is not waterproof at all, I really need a waterproof roof for all the material I have, that&rsquo;s why I put this, I will start today doing
to work with the coconut sleeve to do a waterproof roof. The first step was to reach the top of the coconut tree, but if climbing up the tree seems to be rather easy reaching the palms(棕榈) of that tree with such a smooth trunk is a different kettle of fish. Having accomplished this exploit, I stripped the tree of its palms. I had chosen them because of their length which pretty much matched to the one of my roof Then comes the weaving the method is simple once above,once under,once above,once under.</p>
<p>In the Tongo islands, the roof ot the shelters are covered by layering lattice work which makes them waterproof. Obviously quite a few of them needed anyway. Another major problem I had was the mosquitoes there were thousands of them in that forest,
so the best way to keep them away from my camp was to clean around the shelter and to open up the space so the wind from the ocean could create a natural protection but it did not work.</p>
<p>Since this morning I hear the volcano and I did not know what happened and I was a bit of worried because we never know and that&rsquo;s why I came to the top I have to find a way. I came to the top to have a look at the volcano. The way up to the volcano is not really a piece of cake, especially when it comes to walking through the jungle but once you reach the side of the crater, the sight makes you forget the effort. It&rsquo;s beautiful. You really fell humble in this king of moment. It makes me cry, it is true that somethings I feel lonely the only thing who did not change here it is me. It is true that I miss pretty much everything, I am in the middle of the nature but in the middle of nowhere I am alone, I am really alone, that is not easy.</p>
<p>After my first visit to the volcano I decided that every day I would extend the known perimeter to an extra few hundred meters,
I am always looking a little bit around. There is always things to discover, to find. Today it was a mango(🥭) tree enormous, bending because of too many fruits. To find fruits almost ripe felt like getting Christmas presents.</p>
<p>In order to reinforce my roofing, I needed some rope and on Tofua,the rope tree existed. I only had to find it, that&rsquo;s not solid at all, this is completely rotten, and after several attempts, I finally found what I was looking for, I only had to cut some long straps out of the bard and let them dry under the sun.</p>
<p>I finish one side of the roof today, we still have to see if it is waterproof, of course that at least I did it with nothiing, with my hand, and the coconut sleeve and I am prond of this, and you know the life here, It&rsquo;s very easy but it&rsquo;s not as easy as that everything you have to do yourself. and I learnt a lot about this it gives me a new perception of the world.</p>
<p>Since fishing did not bring me food every day, I added a new dish to my diet, small coconut sprout. The coconut was easy to cut open. The inside looked like a fruit compote, It is hard to describe the taste, soft/a bit sweet, it was excellent.</p>
<p>After more than one months on the island, I was able to survive and get organized the essentials, There was only one problem left
the lack of human contact, what I realize now is that I start feeling lonely. Because I have nobody to talk, I have nobody to change opinion and then I talk to myself but I always agree with me then it is not fun and nobody can give me more information about what I know already and i am just alone whatever I do. I think in my mind I have enough I started to be bored now.</p>
<p>I found a very nice place there but the access is very hard to go from the beach because of all the stones then maybe I can find the easiest way to fo from inside.</p>
<p>Sitting on that beach, I contemplated the vastness of the ocean savoring my victory but taking a look around me I found myself faced with the worst of our civilization.</p>
<p>So much trash, thrown into the ocean thousands of kilometers from here and carried away by the water streams to end up along the shore. I even found a bit of bamboo. What could I use it for &hellip; I decided to bring it back to the camp utill I find a use for it, but I already had my idea.. and now,in theory, i have a didgeridoo.</p>
<p>If you forget the mosquito life on Tofua may seem to be quite mellow, but every day, when going fishing I took the risk of wounding myself walking on the rocks, I regularly scrub myself
during my exploration in the forest I ended up having numerous infection beneath the skin that did not heal anymore, I had to use my satellite phone to call Dr.Richon in Switzerland, he did the follow-up from there.</p>
<p>I have no motivation to do anything anynore now because i am alone, I did not even try to do the fire yet with the wood you know. because &hellip;.</p>
<p>another guy</p>
<p>I came because I coming and need some help to for my friend in my village was cutting his fingers. just as if he had heard me, Lofi appeared in my life. a few days per year, farmers from the neighboring island come to Tofua to cultivate Kawa, a plant whose root is used to produce a bitter drink. Lofi was one of them he knew more or lees where my camp was he came to me hoping that i could save his friend&rsquo;s finger. but their camp was more than six hours walk away, now and on the way back to village of my friend Lofi, because one of his friend had a big cut and fingers a little bit of the finger went out an maybe i can do something I will try to do my best. But if the infection started already it will be too late. The best way to see is to go and have a look.</p>
<p>Lofi preferred to follow me,so he could adapt his speed to mine.
rather than looking over his shoulder to avoid losing me.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t always find solitude even when you look for it. There is about arriving a sailing boat it. It looks like it comes near Hokula. For me it could be an extraordinary visit.And I really look forward to see them. The same boat brought along a group of Norwegians. They were completing two months sailing in the archipelago. For one time it is not me in the camera.</p>
<p>Norwegians: No it is visitors</p>
<p>What do you think about the house?
You saw it yeah?</p>
<p>Norwegians: Not a lot of luxury
real good I guess for you, for the next half year or a year
you have a bed and you have somewhere to hide from the rain
if you are finishing the roof</p>
<p><img src="/img/volcano.png" alt="image">
Before finishing my roof, I took them to the volcano, they had the day,  and I had all the time in the world. It was not the first time I was here but until now I stayed on the crest with tem, I went even closer to the crater.</p>
<p><img src="/img/pig.png" alt="image">
pig found on island</p>
<p><img src="/img/time-stil-running.png" alt="image">
<img src="/img/departure-closing.png" alt="image">
The final departure was closing in. There was one more task to accomplish before leaving the island. When I put the box in the hole, I stopped the time and what I realize now is that even if I wanted to stop the time but the time is still running
but you don&rsquo;t have the same perception and for me it was important always to know what was the day. And I know that every experience has a beginning and has an end. when the experience start when the adventure start. You always have to push forward and in the end,you have to accept that you have quit all this. And it is part of the game to quit all and to go back to the life I had before.</p>
<p><img src="/img/feel-home.png" alt="image">
When I come here I did not konw anything about this place and now I can say after nine months and a half, I feel home.</p>
